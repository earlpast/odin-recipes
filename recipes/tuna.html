    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained</li>
        <li> 1 cup frozen green peas</li>
        <li> ½ (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li> ¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li> 1 cup crushed potato chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and olive oil. Cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.</li>
        <li> Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with a thin layer of sauce. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread about 1/3 ricotta cheese mixture over noodles. Sprinkle about 1/4 mozzarella cheese over ricotta cheese mixture. Ladle about 1/3 meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, finishing with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts and sauce bubbles, about 90 minutes. Cover lasagna with foil if cheese begins to get too dark. Let sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes; drain. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix noodles, condensed soup, 1 cup cheese, tuna, peas, mushrooms, and onion in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li> Top the mixture with crushed potato chip and remaining 1 cup of cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, about 15 to 20 minutes.
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
