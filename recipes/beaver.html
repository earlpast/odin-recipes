    <h1> Beaver Nuggets Recipes</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>

        <li> Mix together warm water, yeast, and 1 pinch white sugar in a large bowl; let sit until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, grease a separate large bowl and set it aside.</li>

        <li>Stir warm milk, eggs, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 1/3 cup white sugar, salt, and vanilla into yeast mixture until sugar is dissolved. Stir in 2 1/2 cups flour until no dry spots remain. Turn dough out onto a floured  surface and knead in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough is no longer sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form dough into a ball and place it into the prepared bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and knead a few times to reshape it. Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of an egg, then roll into an oval shape, about 1/4-inch thick. Place on a dish towel, cover with another dish towel,            and repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Heat 4 inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Make cinnamon sugar: Combine white sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish or pie plate; set aside. </li>
        <li>Lower dough carefully into hot oil in batches and fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on  a paper towel-lined plate. Gently press fried dough into cinnamon sugar while still warm; shake off excess sugar.
        </li>
    </ol>
